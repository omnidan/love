This is still WIP.

Client: `cd www`, run `bower install`, now `cd ..` and run `./prepare.sh`, then `./build.sh`

Server: `cd server`, run `npm install`, now create a `config.json` file with the following contents: `{"apiKey": "PUT YOUR GCM API KEY HERE", "regId": "PUT YOUR GCM REG ID HERE"}`, then run `npm start`
